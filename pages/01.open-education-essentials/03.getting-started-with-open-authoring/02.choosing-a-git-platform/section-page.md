title: Choosing a Git Platform
---

The Git platform you choose affects how contributors interact with your reader and how your content is discovered. All three major platforms support the fork-and-propose workflow, but with meaningful differences.

## Platform Comparison

| Feature | GitHub | Codeberg | GitLab |
|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| Fork-and-propose for unauthenticated users | ✓ (edit mode) | Login required | Login required |
| Open source platform | ✗ (Microsoft) | ✓ (Gitea-based) | Partial (CE edition) |
| Discoverability | Highest | Growing | Moderate |
| Free private repositories | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Built-in CI/CD | ✓ (Actions) | ✓ (Forgejo Actions) | ✓ (Pipelines) |

## For Open Authoring: GitHub

GitHub's edit mode redirects unauthenticated visitors to a fork-and-propose flow automatically – no account required on your repository, just a GitHub account for the contributor. This makes GitHub the lowest-friction choice for open authoring with a public audience.

## For Values Alignment: Codeberg

[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) is a non-profit, open-source Git hosting platform based on Forgejo. It's a strong choice for educators who want their entire toolchain – not just their content – to reflect open values. The Helios Open Reader plugin supports Codeberg natively via the Repository Host setting.

## Recommendation

For most educators starting out: use GitHub for its discoverability and contributor-friendly edit mode. If open-source infrastructure matters to your practice, Codeberg is a principled alternative with full plugin support.

[reflection title="Choosing Your Platform"]
Consider your own teaching context before deciding. Ask yourself:

- How likely are your readers to already have a GitHub account?
- Does it matter to you that your entire workflow – not just your content – is built on open-source tools?
- Would you want contributors to be able to propose changes without contacting you first?

There is no universally correct answer. The right platform is the one that fits your readers, your values, and your willingness to maintain it.
